# Broadcast Graphics

The broadcast graphics project is going to help reinforce our CSS animations skills in creating a graphic that transitions smoothly on and off the screen like in a television broadcast. We will tap into some JavaScript in order to allow for our elements to have dynamic widths depending on their content, and weâ€™ll be able to control our animation with a press of our keyboard!
